Lancha Plana ("flat boat" in Spanish; formerly, Sonora Bar) was a small settlement in Amador County, California, formed as a result of a flatboat ferry crossing across the Mokelumne River. It was founded by Mexican settlers in 1848. It lay on the north bank of the Mokelumne River, 9 miles (14 km) south-southeast of Ione, at an elevation of 220 feet (67 m). The remnants of the town were submerged as a result of the damming of the river to form the Camanche Reservoir. Lancha Plana Bridge crosses the lake now about where the town once stood.
Lancha Plana is registered as a California Historical Landmark.
A post office operated at Lancha Plana from 1859 to 1919, with a closure from 1912 to 1913.
