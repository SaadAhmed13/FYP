Bucyrus is a city in Adams County, North Dakota, United States. The population was 27 at the 2010 census.
The city was founded in 1907 along the Milwaukee Road's transcontinental rail line known as the Pacific Extension. Before being named Bucyrus in 1908, the city was called first Wolf Butte and then Dolan, which was ultimately rejected due to similarity with Doland, South Dakota. The new name Bucyrus was taken from the Bucyrus Company steam shovels used to build the railroad grade within the city.
The town was struck by a wind-fueled wildfire on October 18, 2012. Much of the town was destroyed and 26 people were displaced.
