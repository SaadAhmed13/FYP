Abdul Karim (Arabic: عبد الكريم‎) is a Muslim male given name and, in modern usage, surname. It is built from the Arabic words Abd, al- and Karim. The name means "servant of the most Generous", Al-Karīm being one of the names of God in the Qur'an, which give rise to the Muslim theophoric names.
The letter a of the al- is unstressed, and can be transliterated by almost any vowel, often by e. So the first part can appear as Abdel, Abdul or Abd-al. The second part may appear as Karim, Kareem, Krim or in other ways. The whole name is subject to variable spacing and hyphenation.
