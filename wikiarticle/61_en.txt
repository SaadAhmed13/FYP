Winfield was founded in 1870. It was named for Rev. Winfield Scott, who promised to build the town a church in exchange for the naming rights.
The first post office at Winfield was established in May, 1870.
In 1877, the Florence, El Dorado, and Walnut Valley Railroad Company built a branch line from Florence to El Dorado, in 1881 it was extended to Douglass, and later to Arkansas City. The line was leased and operated by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The line from Florence to El Dorado was abandoned in 1942.

On August 13, 1903, 30-year-old Gilbert Twigg, armed with a 12-gauge double-barrelled shotgun, opened fire at a concert, killing six people and wounding at least 25, before killing himself. Three others died in hospitals afterward. The incident, while largely forgotten today, has been called "America's first modern mass shooting" as many aspects were similar to more widely publicized and deadlier events in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.
The city is well known for hosting the Walnut Valley Festival, a large bluegrass and acoustic music festival, on the third weekend of every September.
