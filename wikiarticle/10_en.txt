A Panchgawahan,Malegaon, Ghoregaon, all three were founded by a Muslim Emperor, there is a considerable Muslim settlement in the town. Therefore there is an old mosque placed on the bazaar road.

The neighbourhood is rich in markets the main one being the one at Malegaon, 3 miles away. One is held at Telhara on Sundays. During the rest of the week, but not on bazar day, the same site is used as a cotton-market. The demand is that of four gins and two presses in the town, but this is sufficient to absorb all the cotton of the locality and to bring perhaps 200 or 250 carts a day into Telhara. A police station and a hospital have been situated here for many years, and there is also a telegraph-office; the schools are vernacular only. A library survives from the time of the important courts now removed. The size of the town causes difficulties about its sanitation, and its commercial activity is somewhat hampered in the rains by the lack of good roads, as the road from Telhara to Adsul is not kept in good condition. The town used to celebrate all festivals.
